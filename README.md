Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
- The Gaming Room is making a game based off of the televison show Win, draw, or Lose. They want to expand this game across multiple platforms but currently operate only on android. Throughout working with the Gaming Room, they wanted me to help expand their game to a wider audience and ensure the game could handle multiple players using different platforms to play.
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
- This documentation gave me a greater depth of knowledge in the server side of things for programming and running games. It also gave me some more practice working with UML diagrams.
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
- Working through the design document helped guide me through the development of code, a road map of sorts. This made something that looked incredibly daunting and diffcult into something doable.
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
- I would go back and redo all of my code. It is riddled with errors and trying to redo the code will give me more practice.
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
- The user reached out to me to assist them in expanding their game across different platforms. If I weren't implenting the users needs into the project then I'm not really doing my job. Its incredibly important to consider the users needs because they have a unique vision for their project but need help completing it. I want to get as close to that vision as possible while making it run smoothly.
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
- At first I had a horrible approach but I realized taking it one chunk at a time and knowing it would take a lot of trial and error helped me. The most important thing for programming is patience, I believe. Follow the clients vision and work with a sense of patience.
